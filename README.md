# App4-Base_Code
This is the base code for App 4 Assignment


consider using a debugging tool called the javaScript Console. It can found in most web browsers developers kits. I can find it by right clicking the app
site and selecting "inspect". This will split the screen with lots of smaller windows. Find the one labeled "console" and watch the console while you
click through the app and it will notify you of the line number of any errors. Be sure to refresh your app from the start. 

If you get this error from the very start ignore it -> Error with Permissions-Policy header: Origin trial controlled feature not enabled: 'interest-cohort'.
